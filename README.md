# Animal-Observation-Database

## About This Project

This project was completed for Quinnipiac University's Advanced Database Programming Course. Utilizing the Microsoft SQL Server and datasets retrieved from both the iNaturalist wesbite/application and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration a database was structured to conveineintly investigate relationships in the data and generate informative reports for different species of animal and how different weather conditions impact the likelihood of observation.

The "Final_Report" document contains a detailed report on all aspects of this project including the datasets utilized, the analysis performed, and the SQL queries written.

## About This Repo

I currently do not have the actual datasets that were imported to my database in this repo, but will be adding them at a later date when I rewrite the queries I used to import the relevant data into my tables (which I foolishly did not save as a procedure the first time I did it.) At present, this is simply a showcase of the tables I generated, the stored procedures I wrote, and the analysis I performed for this project.
